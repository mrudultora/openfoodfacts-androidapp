## What is Open Food Facts?

### A food products database

Open Food Facts is a database of food products with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the tidbits of information we can find on product labels.

### Made by everyone

Open Food Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.
25000+ contributors like you have added 1,1M+ products from 150 countries using our Android, iPhone or Windows Phone app or their camera to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.

### For everyone

Data about food is of public interest and has to be open. The complete database is published as open data and can be reused by anyone and for any use. Check-out the cool reuses or make your own!

For historic reasons, it's openfoodfacts.github.scrachx.openfood in the code and on F-Droid.|

## Running a Fastlane lane
The project uses Fastlane to automate release and screenshots generation.
* First time you checkout, run `bundle install` at the root of the project
* Then launch lanes using `bundle exec fastlane release` (for example the release lane)

## Generate screenshots for the Play Store
To activate the `screenshots` buildType in IDE, uncomment `def result = "screenshots"` and comment the other line otherwise the folder androidTestScreenshots is not recognized as a test folder.
To generate localized screenshots of the app on your local computer, launch the command `gradlew connectedOffScreenshotsAndroidTest --stacktrace --info -PtestBuildType=screenshots` with a physical device attached to your computer
[Help is welcome to improve](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-androidapp/labels/screenshot-generation)
